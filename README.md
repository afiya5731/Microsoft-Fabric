# Microsoft-Fabric

Microsoft Fabric is a data analytics platform that handles your entire data workflow, from collecting and processing data to building reports and dashboards. It combines data ingestion, transformation, real-time event routing, and visualization through workloads like Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Real-Time Intelligence, Data Warehouse, and Databases.

As a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, Fabric centralizes data storage with OneLake. It embeds AI capabilities throughout, so you don't need to integrate services manually, allowing you to transform raw data into actionable insights efficiently.

### Warehouse or lakehouse
When deciding between using a warehouse or a lakehouse, it's important to consider the specific needs and context of your data management and analytics requirements.

Choose a data warehouse when you need an enterprise-scale solution with open standard format, no knobs performance, and minimal setup.  Best suited for semi-structured and structured data formats, the data warehouse is suitable for both beginner and experienced data professionals, offering simple and intuitive experiences.

Choose a lakehouse when you need a large repository of highly unstructured data from heterogeneous sources and want to use Spark as your primary development tool. Acting as a 'lightweight' data warehouse, you always have the option to use the SQL analytics endpoint and T-SQL tools to deliver reporting and data intelligence scenarios in your lakehouse.

You always have the opportunity to add one or the other at a later point should your business needs change and regardless of where you start, both the warehouse and the lakehouse use the same powerful SQL engine for all T-SQL queries.
