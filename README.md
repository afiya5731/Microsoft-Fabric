# Microsoft-Fabric

Microsoft Fabric is a data analytics platform that handles your entire data workflow, from collecting and processing data to building reports and dashboards. It combines data ingestion, transformation, real-time event routing, and visualization through workloads like Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Real-Time Intelligence, Data Warehouse, and Databases.

As a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, Fabric centralizes data storage with OneLake. It embeds AI capabilities throughout, so you don't need to integrate services manually, allowing you to transform raw data into actionable insights efficiently.
